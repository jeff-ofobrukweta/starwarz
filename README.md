## About The Project

[![Landing Page][product-screenshot]](https://store.luminskin.com/products?language=en)

### Instructions

As this is a simple consume website for the Star Wars API - there are a few things a user is probably going to want to do.

1.View all root types, and the resources inside them
2.Click though and see a detailed breakdown of the information on each resource type
3.Easily access other linked resources
4.Favorite a resource type - this must persist after page refresh however it doesn't need to be stored on a server

#### Requirements

1.The UI has to be responsive
2.Loading states while the data is being fetched
3.Test coverage report
4.As important as the feature set is, keeping coding standards and code consistency is key
5.Use react query or redux, whichever you are comfortable with.
6.Add type support by migrating to TypeScript

#### Design
A good understanding of basic UX principles, and showing that user flow and key actions have been thought through thoroughly
This is Star Wars isn't it? Have some fun!

#### Submission

Push your code to a version control service such as github or gitlab and send a link to the shared repository to jordan@menskin.co
